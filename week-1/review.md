# Reflect On Learning

# Summary

Reflection is a powerful learning tool.  For this challenge you will create journal 
1. [Reflect on Learning](#reflect-on-learning)
1. [Review, Reflect, and Iterate](#review-reflect-and-iterate)
1. Prep: [Reading Practical Object Oriented Design In Ruby](#prep-reading-practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby)
1. [Feedback Loops](#feedback-loops)
1. [Apprenticeship Patterns: Exposing Your Ignorance](#apprenticeship-patterns-exposing-your-ignorance)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reflect On Learning

List 10 major topics covered this week (e.g. *recursion*).

Then choose two of these topics and describe what you learned about them in several sentences.

Give at least one code example (that was not provided in the challenges) to illustrate your description.

Make a pull request against the phase one guide with reflections in a text or markdown file.

# Review Reflect And Iterate

Choose two of the hardest review challenges from this weekend, then read, dig into, and comment on 3 other members of your cohorts attempts for each of these challenges. Make sure you include:
- Something you learned from their attempt
- Something you think they did well
- Something you think could be more in line with the four rules of simple design

Feel free to ask other people to explain things to you. Remember, your understanding is the most important part.

Make a pull request against the phase one guide with these reflections in a text or markdown file.

Now, redo your most difficult week review challenge. Focus on the applying the things you learned from the review you did as well as the four rules of simple design.

Make a new pull request against the challenge you reviewed.

Once you have re-completed the review challenge, answer the following questions:
- How did reviewing other peoples code impact your second attempt?
- What questions did you dive into when reviewing the other code?
- Did you run into any dead ends that you don't understand? Enumerate 2 or 3 of the dead ends you dove into.

# Prep Reading Practical Object Oriented Design In Ruby

Read Chapter 2 and 3 of "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"

You can access a copy of this on the Books Dropbox—or there is a hard copy on the bookshelf at DBC.

[Dropbox link to book] [1]

As you are reading Chapter 2–Come up with your own Object (like the authors Bicycle) and try to apply each concept to your Object. We will discuss on Monday.

**Note**: You should read the rest of the book throughout week 2.

# Feedback Loops

### Learning Goals
- Discover the feedback loops in your daily coding life.
- Learn some of your natural strengths in regards to coding.

### Objectives

#### Get some Knowledge
Read [OODA's wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)

#### Apply the knowledge

There are a ton of different feedback loops you'll experience while coding at DBC

1. Working on a Challenge
2. Adding a Feature
3. Debugging an error
4. Switching drivers while pairing
5. Morning/Afternoon sessions
6. And probably way more.

Reflect on:

- Which step(s) do you gravitate to when solving a problem?
- Which step(s) do you tend to skip when solving a problem?
- What effects occur when you skip a step or spend too long in one step?

**Select 1 of these coding feedback loops and describe how you observe, orient, decide, and act when in them.**

**Identify at least 1 additional feedback loop in your daily life. Describe how you OODA it.**

# Apprenticeship Patterns: Exposing Your Ignorance

It's really hard for smart, hard working, passionate people to admit when they don't get something. Our natural tendency is to guard our ignorance so that everyone thinks we're competent.

Effective developers expose their ignorance. Period.

### Learning Goals
* Why revealing ignorance helps gain confidence.
* Begin to understand your weaknesses.

### Instructions
1. Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance)
2. Answer the following questions:

- When have you chosen not to expose your ignorance, and what impact did it have on your effectiveness?
- What are the 5 things you feel like you understand the least about computer programming? Try to keep it to stuff that you've tried to understand in the past.
- What is the way you feel most comfortable exposing your ignorance?
