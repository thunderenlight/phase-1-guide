# Week 1:  Weekend

### Challenges

##### Core Challenges
Either with a pair or on your own, complete the following challenges.
- [Review: Abstract Data Structures](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-abstract-data-structures-challenge)
- [Review: Calculating Subsets with Recursion](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-calculating-subsets-with-recursion-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect and Iterate](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-reflect-and-iterate-challenge)
- [Review: Reflect on Learning](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-reflect-on-learning-challenge)
- [Review: Revisit Roman Numerals](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-revisit-roman-numeral-challenge)
- [Review: Enumerable Methods](https://github.com/grasshoppers-2014/review-enumerable-methods-challenge)

### Required Reading
- Read Chapters 2 and 3 of [Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby](http://www.beginsmarter.com/pdf/Practical_OO_Design_Ruby.pdf).  There is a hardcopy available on the DBC bookshelf.  An electronic copy is available in the [DBC Books Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cyje5e6cfk708al/USop5LBSQA).  As you read, come up with your own real-world object--like the author's bicycle--and try to apply each concept to your object.  You should finish reading the book throughout Week 2.
- Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance).  It's really hard for smart, hard-working, passionate people to admit when they don't get something. Our natural tendency is to guard our ignorance so that everyone thinks we're competent.  Effective developers expose their ignorance. Period.

### Inspiration
- The challenges provided during the week are a guide to start you on a learning path. They should serve as a minimum goal for your learning.  For the high bar, consider that some of our students [wrote and published their own gem](https://github.com/sandbochs/local_message) while still in Phase 1, [wrote useful applications](http://www.codequizzes.com/) over the weekend between phase 1 and 2, and went on to [generally change the world shortly thereafter](http://devbootcamp.com/2013/08/19/how-dbcers-are-turning-your-browser-into-a-snake-playing-gosling-loving-wonderwolrd/).
