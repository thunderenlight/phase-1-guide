# Enacting Enumerables

## Learning Competencies

* Research and understand the Enumerable methods
* Elucidate the action of a method with a real world example

## Summary

Create a skit to bring a pair of Enumerable methods to life! Get creative. What is the most memorable way you can elucidate what these Enumerable methods do? The funnier the better. Make sure your fellow boots never forget these Enumerable methods!

You will work in your weekly groups. Each group will be assigned a pair of enumerable methods that perform somewhat similar functions.  In addition to making clear what each method does, we also want to clearly see how the methods differ.  Be sure to demonstrate or explain on what type of object the method is called and the return value.
