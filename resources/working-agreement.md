### Core Hours Overview
- You will meet with your accountability buddies at 7:45 a.m. every week day; text or call your buddies if they are not present or if you are running late.

- Core hours are 8:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.  You are expected to be onsite and ready to work during this time.  If you have extenuating circumstances, let your instructors know as soon as possible.  During lunch, 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m., you are free; however, there may be days when you are asked to be onsite during lunch (e.g., for assessment review).

- At 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. we will meet in the open area near the Phase 1 work stations for announcements.

### Phase 1 Priorities
- Learning how to appropriately respond versus reactâ€¦ to error messages, challenges, and self talk.
- Learning how to communicate what you're feeling, thinking, and needing.
- Learning how to build and use mental models.
- Helping each other to grow both as individuals and as a tribe.
